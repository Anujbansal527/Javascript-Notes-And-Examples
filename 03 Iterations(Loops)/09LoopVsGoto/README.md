# 🔄 Loop vs 🚫 Goto in JavaScript

## 📘 Introduction

JavaScript doesn’t support `goto`, and for good reasons. Let’s explore why structured loops are better, safer, and more maintainable.

## 🔁 Loop vs Goto: Comparison Table

| Feature            | Loop (`for`, `while`, etc.)                     | Goto (❌ Not in JavaScript)                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Structured Flow | Follows a predictable, readable control flow     | Can jump *anywhere* in code, often messy           |
| ✅ Readability     | Easy to understand, follow and debug             | Hard to follow logic due to jumps                  |
| ✅ Scoping         | Maintains block/function scope                   | Breaks scope rules                                 |
| ✅ Reusability     | Can be used with conditions, breaks, continues   | No clean way to combine with reusable logic        |
| ❌ JS Support      | Fully supported (`for`, `while`, etc.)           | **Not supported in JavaScript**                    |
| ❗ Risk            | Minimal (if used correctly)                      | High (spaghetti code, bugs)                        |
| 🚫 Error-Prone     | Less prone to logic errors                       | More prone to logical confusion & bugs             |

## ❓ Why JavaScript Doesn’t Support `goto`

> JavaScript was designed with **structured programming** principles in mind.

- `goto` creates **unstructured jumps**, breaking the logical flow
- It causes **spaghetti code** — code that's hard to read, debug, or maintain
- Even in C/C++, `goto` is considered bad practice
- JavaScript offers **safe and readable alternatives**:
  - `for`, `while`, `do...while`
  - `break`, `continue`
  - `return` (to exit functions early)
  - **Labeled loops** (to break nested loops in a structured way)

---

## ✅ Example: Labeled Loop (Structured Goto-like)

```js
outerLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    if (i === 1 && j === 1) {
      break outerLoop; // exits both loops, cleanly!
    }
    console.log(`i=${i}, j=${j}`);
  }
}
```

This gives similar control like `goto`, but in a **safe, readable way**!

## 🧠 Interview Q&A

### 🔹 Q: Why doesn't JavaScript support `goto`?
**Ans:** Because it promotes unstructured, unreadable code. JavaScript encourages **structured programming** through loops, conditionals, and function-based flow control.

### 🔹 Q: Can we simulate `goto`-like behavior?
**Ans:** Yes, using **labeled loops** and **`break`** or **`return`** statements.

### 🔹 Q: What to use instead of `goto`?
**Ans:**
- Use `break` to exit loops
- Use `return` to exit functions
- Use labeled loops for nested control

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Loops** = Safe, readable, and maintainable
- **Goto** = Error-prone, messy, and **not allowed in JavaScript**
- JavaScript provides better tools: loops + break/continue + labels

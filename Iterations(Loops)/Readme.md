# 🔁 JavaScript Loops – Complete Guide

Welcome to the **JavaScript Loops** module!  
Loops allow you to **run code repeatedly** as long as a condition is true. They are a **core part** of logic building in JS — from printing a list to building complex patterns.

## 🔷 Real-World Analogy:

> Jab tak light green nahi hoti (🚦), hum rukte hain.  
> Same tarah loop bhi tab tak chalta hai jab tak condition true hoti hai.

## 📘 Why Use Loops?

- Repetition: Repeat same code multiple times
- Automation: Process arrays, objects, or inputs dynamically
- Clean Code: Avoid writing same logic again & again

## 🔁 Types of Loops in JavaScript

| Loop Type        | Use Case                                | Entry/Exit | Supports Break/Continue |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| `for`            | When iterations are known/countable      | Entry      | ✅ Yes                   |
| `while`          | When condition-based iteration needed    | Entry      | ✅ Yes                   |
| `do...while`     | Guaranteed 1-time run, then check        | Exit       | ✅ Yes                   |
| `for...of`       | Iterate over **values** (Array, String)  | Entry      | ✅ Yes                   |
| `for...in`       | Iterate over **keys** (Objects)          | Entry      | ✅ Yes                   |

## 💡 Common Mistakes in Loops (Avoid These!)

1. **Infinite Loops**: No increment or wrong condition
2. **Wrong Indexing**: Using `i <= arr.length` instead of `i < arr.length`
3. **Modifying array while looping**
4. **Wrong use of `for...in` with arrays** (for...of preferred)
5. **Using `var` inside loops** instead of `let`
